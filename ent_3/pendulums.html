  <!-- I dedicate this sketch to a past version of myself who, -->
  <!-- in accordance with his naive self, thought that he could find a way -->
  <!-- to avoid using the 'stupid' small-angle approximation for pendulum motion -->
  <!-- by deriving (or rather, integrating) an exact formula starting from Newton's Law -->
  <!-- I was an idiot back then. I'd like for everyone reading this to know that I'm still an idiot -->
  <!-- Except this time, I've left the differential equations as 'an exercise for the computer' -->
  <!-- If you're reading this, I've left a bunch of comments on the actual code file -->
  <!-- They are about as useless as this train of comments, but today I'd like to quote one of the lines I left there -->
  <!-- The quality of the code behind this animation is 'so crap, it's not even worth copying [or admiring]' -->
  <!-- But the pendulums have left me hypnotized in a trance ... -->
