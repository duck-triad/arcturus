# You're probably here to get some questions answered.


## What is Arcturus?
[Arcturus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus) is the fourth-brightest star in the night sky and exists inside the Bo√∂tes constellation.

## Why do some of the sketches run so slowly?
Some of these sketches started off as Java-based experiments and were later hammered into the JS syntax. I have been told that Java does some things quicker than Javascript.

## Is the source code available?
Yes, via Github and the "inspect element" feature on most modern browsers. 

## Who is the author of this page?
This is a good question but hard to explain. For now, know all roads to Hamburg, Iowa, kaleidoscopically merge onto uncharted lane intersections.
