  <!-- Project. A funny word -->
  <!-- Pronounced one way, it's an idea under construction -->
  <!-- And pronounced in another, it's the magnification of an idea to the big screen -->
  <!-- This project is the culmination of nearly a year of procrastination, tinkering with the Perlin noise space and general grad school shenanigans -->
  <!-- Yet within, it is the projection of a 3D landscape on a 2D canvas -->
  <!-- What results is a beautiful mess -->
  <!-- As always, this sketch is protected by the Ultimate Defense Against Plagiarism -->
